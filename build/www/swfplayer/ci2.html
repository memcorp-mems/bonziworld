<b><p style="color:lime;">The goal in the game is to infect all yellow shapes with brown color by colliding them with brown shapes but keep all green shapes uninfected. Press B to toggle Color Blind Mode. Press 1-9 to set game speed. Default is 1. (I strongly recommend you set it as default when you play the game first time.) Click a pink object to destroy it.</p></b>
