<b><p style="color:lime;">The goal in the game is to infect all yellow shapes with brown color by colliding them with brown shapes but keep all green shapes uninfected by avoiding colliding them with brown shapes. ONLY yellow and green shapes can be infected. Click pink shapes to remove them. Click black bombs to explode them. There is a speed adjuster at the top bar in level.</p></b>
