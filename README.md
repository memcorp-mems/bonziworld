# BonziWORLD

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run your own BonziWORLD, by all means go ahead. Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm

## Setup
The setup has been simplified and the bonziworld server is ready to use
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/memcorp-mems/bonziworld
cd bonziworld
```

### Start the server
```
cd server
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 80. (http://localhost:80/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
